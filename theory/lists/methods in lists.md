1. ADDING ELEMENTS WITH "append()"
- This is used to add an item to the end of the list.
- Here is an example of using the append() method to add the number 6 to a list of numbers:
-   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    numbers.append(6)
    print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

- If you want to add one list at the end of another, you can also use the append() method like this:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    even_numbers = [6, 8, 10]
    
    numbers.append(even_numbers)
    print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [6, 8, 10]]
- Notice how the entire even_numbers list is nested inside of the numbers list.

2. ADDING MULTIPLE ELEMENTS WITH "extend()"
- But if you want to add all of the individual numbers from the even_numbers list at the end of the numbers list, then you can use the extend() method.
- The extend() method is similar to the append() method, but with extend() you can add multiple elements from one list to another. Here's an example of adding the numbers 6, 8, and 10 from one list to the end of the numbers list:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    even_numbers = [6, 8, 10]
    
    numbers.extend(even_numbers)
    print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10]
- As you can see, the nested list is gone and it's just a list of numbers.

3. INSERTING ELEMENTS AT A SPECIFIC INDEX - insert()
- To insert an element at a specific index in a list, you can use the insert() method.
-  This method accepts two arguments: the index where you wish to insert the new item and the item you want to insert.
-  Here is an example of using the insert() method:
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      numbers.insert(2, 2.5)
      
      print(numbers) # [1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]
- The preceding code will insert the number 2.5 at index 2 in the numbers list.

4. REMOVING ELEMENTS FROM A LIST- remove()
- If you want to remove an element from a list, you can use the remove() method. The remove() method takes the value of the element to remove as an argument:
    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50]
    numbers.remove(50)
    
    print(numbers) # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
- It is important to note that this method will only remove the first occurrence of an item, not all of them:
      numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50]
      numbers.remove(50)
      print(numbers) # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50]

5. REMOVING AN ELEMENT AR A SPECIFIC INDEX IN THE LIST- pop()
- To remove an element at a specific index in the list, you can use the pop() method like this:
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      numbers.pop(1) # The number 2 is returned
- If you don't specify an index for the pop method, then the last element is removed.
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      numbers.pop() # The number 5 is returned

6. CLEARING A LIST- clear()
- If you need to empty the list, then you can use the clear() method like this:
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      numbers.clear()
      print(numbers) # []

7. SORT A LIST- sort()
- This method is used to sort the elements in place.
- Here is an example of sorting a random list of numbers in place:
      numbers = [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]
      numbers.sort()
      print(numbers) # [1, 2, 19, 35, 41, 67]

8. FUNCTION THAT SORTS ITERABLES- sorted()
- In contrast to the sort() method, there is the sorted() function which works for any iterable and returns a new sorted list instead of modifying the original list. For example:
      numbers = [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]
      sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
      print(numbers) # [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]
      print(sorted_numbers) # [1, 2, 19, 35, 41, 67]
- As a reminder, an iterable is a special type of object that you can loop over, allowing you to access each item one at a time.
- Both the sort() method and sorted() function accept optional key and reverse parameters.

9. REVERSING A LIST- reverse()
- This method will reverse a list of elements in place like this:
      numbers = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
      numbers.reverse()
      print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

10. FINDING THE INDEX OF AN ELEMENT
- This is used to find the first index where an element can be found in a list.
-  Here is an example of using the index method to find the language 'Java' in a programming_languages list:
      programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']
      programming_languages.index('Java')       # 1

- If the element cannot be found, then Python throws a ValueError:
        programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']
        programming_languages.index('JavaScript')
        
        """
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        ValueError: 'JavaScript' is not in list
        """
